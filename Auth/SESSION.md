<h3 id="createSession">Create Session</h3>
This API endpoint creates an unverified session.<br><br>

**EndPoint:** <https://intelligence.threatwinds.com/api/auth/v2/session>

> <h4> Parameters</h4>
  
* **email** (_string_) _**unique**_ The email parameter represents the session's email address that is associated with the account. _e.g.: john@doe.net_<br><br>

To create a session, use a **POST**</span> request, for example:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://intelligence.threatwinds.com/api/auth/v2/session' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \

<h5>Return a Session as Response</h5>

We get this code when the session was created successfully. It returns a <a href="./SESSION.md">Session</a>. Remember that you need to verify the seesion berfore you can use it.

>Fields of the response:

> <h5> Code 400 - Bad request</h5>

The HTTP status code 400, also known as a "Bad Request" error, is typically returned when the server is unable to process the client's request due to issues with the request parameters. This could happen when the email parameter provided in the request is not valid.

e.g.:

```
