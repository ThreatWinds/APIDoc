<h3 id="createKeyPair">Create KeyPair</h3>
This API endpoint creates an unverified KeyPair.<br><br>

**EndPoint:** <https://intelligence.threatwinds.com/api/auth/v2/keypair>

> <h4> Parameters</h4>
  
* **Authorization header** (_string_): This authorization header can be obtained from an active session of the account. Please ensure that the session is active before attempting to retrieve the authorization header for account deletion._e.g.:
* **Message** (_JSON_):
  * **days**	(_integer_): The 'days' parameter specifies the length of time, in days, that the key pair will remain valid. _e.g.: 365_
  * **name**	(_string_): "The 'name' parameter is used to specify a name or identifier for the key pair. _e.g.: Example_
<br>

To create a KeyPair, use a **POST**</span> request, for example:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://intelligence.threatwinds.com/api/auth/v2/keypair' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer fq6JoEFTsxiXAl1cVdPDnK4emIQCwaUBfq9JoEFTsxhXAl1cVxPDnK4emIQCwaUB' \

  -d '{
  "days": 365,
  "name": "Example"
}'
```

><h4>Returns</h4>

>Fields of the response:

* **apiKey** (_string_): The apiKey is a unique identifier that, when combined with the apiSecret, serves as a method of authentication for accessing to the endpoints that require authentication. It acts as a public key that identifies the authorized user or system making the API request.
  
* **apiSecret** (_string_): The apiSecret is a piece of confidential information that, when combined with the apiKey, serves as a method of authentication for accessing to the endpoints that require it. Ensure to save the apiSecret in a safe place, this will not be shown again.

* **verificationCodeID** (_string_): The verification code id that is used in the <a href="./KeyPair.md">KeyPair Verification Endpoint</a> to ensure that the KeyPair is valid. _e.g.: 5f35d2c4-5633-4b16-bbf0-5ca22ef8ea2e_<br>

* **expireAt** (_integer_): A timestamp that represents the expiration datetime of the KeyPair. _e.g.:1674492894_<br>

* **keyID** (_string_): The id of the KeyPair that was created. _e.g.: 5f35d2c4-5633-4b16-bbf0-5ca22ef8ea2e_<br>

> <h5> Code 400 - Bad request</h5>

The HTTP status code 400, also known as a "Bad Request" error, is typically returned when the server is unable to process the client's request due to issues with the request parameters. This could happen when the authorization header parameter provided in the request is not valid.

e.g.:

```json
{
  "uuid": "85f0c8a9-d361-49e9-a9d1-826c770fcffb",
  "error": "incorrect authorization header"
}
```
> <h5> Code 401 - Authentication required
Authentication required</h5>

The 401 error code indicates that you need authentication to do this request.

> <h5> Code 404 - Not found</h5>

The HTTP status code 404, also known as a "Not Found" error occurs when the requested resource, in this case, the user, cannot be found.

There are several reasons why this may occur, such as the user not existing in the system or the session that is being used for authentication no longer being active. It's important to double-check the authorization header before attempting to use it.

For example:

```
{
  "uuid": "7ae253bc-b1ca-4e8b-a5ca-268645e76f60",
  "error": "record not found"
}
```

> <h5> Code 500 - Internal server error</h5>
