> <h5> Code 400 - Bad request</h5>

The HTTP status code 400, also known as a "Bad Request" error, is typically returned when the server is unable to process the client's request due to issues with the request parameters.

For example:

```json
{
  "uuid": "cf096e86-347f-4ddf-af1c-0c673a004211",
  "error": "value cannot be empty"
}
```
> <h5> Code 401 - Authentication required
Authentication required</h5>

The 401 error code indicates that you need authentication to do this request. See <a> Authentication API Page</a> for more details.

For example:

```json
{
  "uuid": "4b2561eb-2b4b-43ee-a272-643df36e2c5b",
  "error": "authentication required"
}
```

> <h5> Code 403 - Forbidden</h5>
A 403 error code, also known as a Forbidden error, indicates that the server understood the client's request, but it is refusing to fulfill it. The server can return a 403 error if you do not have enough permissions to make this operation, it suspects that the client is making too many requests, or if the client is using an IP address that is banned or blocked by the server. If the error persists you should contact support for further assistance.

For example:
```json
{
  "uuid": "75827622-bb05-46b5-80a9-344a6df0e001",
  "error": "unauthorized"
}
