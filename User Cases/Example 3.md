<h4>Website Reputation Chrome Extension</h4>

A developer is designing a chrome extension to provide users with real-time updates about the reputation and related information of websites they visit. The extension will leverage a script that extracts the domain name of the current website the user is on, and then utilize our service to retrieve any available information about the website's reputation and any associated malware.


**STEP 1** 

The first step is to search if the website or domain exists in our dataset. If it does not, it is good news for the user. However, if it is present in the dataset, it may pose a risk to the user.

To quickly determine if a website or domain is in our dataset, we can use the "Get Entity by Type and Value" endpoint. 

For example, suppose a user enters the domain `http://acescencyhipotetic.com/aWebPage/index.html`. In this case, we need to check if this domain has a negative reputation.

```json
{
    "query": {
        "bool": {
            "must": [
                {
                    "term": {
                        "attributes.domain": {
                            "value": "acescencyhipotetic.com"
                        }
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}

```

The response would contain the domain entity, as shown below:

```json
{
  "pages": 1,
  "items": 1,
  "results": [
    {
      "@timestamp": "2023-04-04T21:18:37.758694707Z",
      "accuracy": 2,
      "attributes": {
        "domain": "acescencyhipotetic.com"
      },
      "id": "domain-59f5e994104053f590acdd1d2d72071669c839a60fc68291110facfa2fd16396",
      "reputation": -2,
      "type": "domain"
    }
  ]
}
```

Based on the provided information, we can conclude that the domain associated with the given URL has a negative reputation and visiting it may pose a risk to the user.


**STEP 2** We can now retrieve the entities associated with this domain:

```json
{
  "pages": 1,
  "items": 1,
  "results": [
    {
      "@timestamp": "2023-04-04T21:02:42.717161656Z",
      "accuracy": 1,
      "attributes": {
        "threat": "expansion on 123@123.com"
      },
      "id": "threat-d8257cec79ed8b20c32decd305c1692391c185ab13d52b3495ea486df5385b27",
      "reputation": -2,
      "type": "threat"
    }
  ]
}
```

Now, you can create an alert for the user, informing them that they have a considerable risk on this website based on its negative reputation and associations.
